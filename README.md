# Specifications for bioimage.io

This repository contains specifications defined by the bioimage.io community. These specifications are used for defining fields in YAML 1.2 files which should be named `rdf.yaml`. Such a rdf.yaml --- along with files referenced in it --- can be downloaded from or uploaded to the [bioimage.io website](https://bioimage.io) and may be produced or consumed by bioimage.io-compatible consumers (e.g. image analysis software like ilastik).

bioimage.io-compatible resources must fulfill the following rules:

Note that the Python package PyYAML does not support YAML 1.2 .
We therefore use and recommend [ruyaml](https://ruyaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
For differences see <https://ruamelyaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyyaml>.

Please also note that the best way to check whether your `rdf.yaml` file is bioimage.io-compliant is to call `bioimageio.core.validate` from the [bioimageio.core](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python) Python package.
The [bioimageio.core](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python) Python package also provides the bioimageio command line interface (CLI) with the `validate` command:

```terminal
bioimageio validate path/to/your/rdf.yaml
```

## Format version overview

All bioimage.io description formats are defined as [Pydantic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/).

| type | format version | documentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| model | 0.5 </br> 0.4 | [model_spec_v0-5.md](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/model_spec_v0-5.md) </br> [model_spec_v0-4.md](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/model_spec_v0-4.md) |
| dataset | 0.3 </br> 0.2 | [dataset_spec_v0-3.md](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/dataset_spec_v0-3.md) </br> [dataset_spec_v0-2.md](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/dataset_spec_v0-2.md) |
| notebook | 0.3 </br> 0.2 | [notebook_spec_v0-3.md](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/notebook_spec_v0-3.md) </br> [notebook_spec_v0-2.md](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/notebook_spec_v0-2.md) |
| application | 0.3 </br> 0.2 | [application_spec_v0-3.md](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/application_spec_v0-3.md) </br> [application_spec_v0-2.md](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/application_spec_v0-2.md) |
| collection | 0.3 </br> 0.2 | [collection_spec_v0-3.md](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/collection_spec_v0-3.md) </br> [collection_spec_v0-2.md](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/collection_spec_v0-2.md) |
| generic | 0.3 </br> 0.2 | [generic_spec_v0-3.md](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/generic_spec_v0-3.md) </br> [generic_spec_v0-2.md](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/generic_spec_v0-2.md) |

## JSON schema

Simplified descriptions are available as [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/):

| bioimageio.spec version | JSON schema |
| --- | --- |
| latest | [bioimageio_schema_latest.json](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/bioimageio_schema_latest.json) |
| 0.5 | [bioimageio_schema_v0-5.json](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/bioimageio_schema_v0-5.json) |

These are primarily intended for syntax highlighting and form generation.

## Examples

We provide some [examples for using rdf.yaml files to describe models, applications, notebooks and datasets](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/main/example_descriptions/examples.md).

## üíÅ Recommendations

* Due to the limitations of storage services such as Zenodo, which does not support subfolders, it is recommended to place other files in the same directory level of the `rdf.yaml` file and try to avoid using subdirectories.
* Use the [bioimageio.core Python package](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python) to validate your `rdf.yaml` file.
* bioimageio.spec keeps evolving. Try to use and upgrade to the most current format version!

## ‚å® bioimageio command-line interface (CLI)

The bioimageio CLI has moved entirely to [bioimageio.core](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python).

## üñ• Installation

bioimageio.spec can be installed with either `conda` or `pip`, we recommend to install `bioimageio.core` instead:

```console
conda install -c conda-forge bioimageio.core
```

or

```console
pip install -U bioimageio.core
```
