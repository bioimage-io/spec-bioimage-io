# Bioimiage.io Configuration Specification

The model zoo specification contains configuration definitions for the following categories:
- `Transformation`: configuration of a tensor to tensor transformation, that can be used for pre-processing operations (like normalization), post-processing, etc.
- `Model`: configuration of a trainable (deep-learning) model.
- `Reader`: configuration of a data-source + how to read from it.
- `Sampler`: configuration of a sampling procedure given a `Reader.`

The configurations are represented by a yaml file.

To get a quick overview of the config file, see an example file [here](./models/UNet2dExample.model.yaml).

## Current `format_version`: 0.1.0

## Common keys

Each configuration must contain the following keys:
`name`, `description`, `cite`, `authors`, `documentation`, `tags` `format_version`, `language`, `framework`,`source`, `kwargs`.
<!---
Do we have any optional config keys?
-->

### `name`
Name of the transformation. This name should equal the name of any existing, logically equivalent object of the same category in another framework.

###  `description`
A string containing a brief description. 

### `cite`
A citation entry or list of citation entries.
Each entry contains of a mandatory `text` field and either one or both of `doi` and `url`.

### `license`
A string to a common license name (e.g. `MIT`, `APLv2`) or a relative path to the license file.

### `authors`
A list of author strings. 
A string can be seperated by `;` in order to identify multiple handles per author.

### `documentation`
Relative path to file with additional documentation in markdown.

### `tags`
A list of tags.

### `covers`
A list of cover images provided by either a relative path to the model folder, or a hyperlink starts with `https`.

Please use an image smaller than 500KB, aspect ratio width to height 2:1. The supported image formats are: `jpg`, `png`, `gif`.

### `format_version`
Version of this bioimage.io configuration specification. This is mandatory, and important for the consumer software to verify before parsing the fields.
The recommended behavior for the implementation is to keep backward compatibility, and throw error if the model yaml is in an unsupported format version.

### `language`

Programming language of the model definition. For now, we support `python` and `java`.
<!---
What about `javascript`?
-->

###  `framework`

The deep learning framework for which this object has been implemented. For now, we support `pytorch` and `tensorflow`.
Can be `null` if the implementation is not framework specific.

### `model`
 - `source`: Language and framework specific implementation. This can either point to a local implementation:
  `<relative path to file>:<identifier of implementation within the source file>`
  or the implementation in an available dependency: `<root-dependency>.<sub-dependency>.<identifier>`. 
  
    For example:
      - `./my_function:MyImplementation`
      - `core_library.some_module.some_function`
      <!---
      java: <path-to-jar>:ClassName ?
      -->

 - `kwargs`: Keyword arguments for the implementation specified by [`source`](#source).

 - `sha256`: SHA256 checksum of the model file (for both serialized model file or source code).

  You can generate the SHA256 code for your model and weights by using for example, `hashlib` in Python, here is a codesnippet:
  ```python
  import hashlib
  
  # set your actual file name below
  with open(filename,"rb") as f:
      bytes = f.read() # read entire file as bytes
      readable_hash = hashlib.sha256(bytes).hexdigest();
      print(readable_hash)
  ```

  Or you can drag and drop your file to this [online tool](http://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256_checksum.html) to generate it in your browser.


<!---
Do we want any positional arguments ? mandatory or optional?
-->

### `weights`
A list of weights, each weights definition contains the following fields:
 - `id`: an unique id which will be used to refer the weights, e.g. in `prediction` or `training`.
 - `name`: the name of the weights for display, it should be a human-friendly name in title case
 - `description`: description about the weights, it is recommended to describe the how the weights is trained, and what's the dataset used for training.
 - `authors`: a list of authors. This field is optional, only required if the authors are different from the model.
 - `covers`: a list of cover images. This is used for showing how the inputs and outputs looks like with this weights file.
 - `source`: link to the weights file. Preferably an url to the weights file.
 - `sha256`: SHA256 checksum of the model weight file specified by `source` (see `models` section above for how to generate SHA256 checksum)

## Transformation Specification

A transformation describes an operation that takes a list of input tensors and produces a list of output tensors.
<!--
Stateful, stateless, do we care?
-->

A confiuration entry in the bioimage.io model zoo is defined by a configuration file `<transformation name>.transformation.yaml`.
The configuration file must contain the [common keys](#common-keys) and the keys `inputs`, `outputs` and `dependencies`.

### `inputs`
Describes the input tensors expected by this transformation.
Either a string from the following choices:
  - any: any number/shape of input tensors is accepted/returned

or a list of [tensor specifications](#tensor-specification).

### `outputs`
Either a string from the following choices:
  - any: any number/shape of input tensors is accepted/returned
  - identity: number/shape of output tensors is the same as input tensors
  - same number: same number of tensors as given to input is returned (shape may differ)

or a list of [tensor specifications](#tensor-specification).

#### tensor specification
Specification of a tensor.
- `name`: tensor name
- `axes`: string of axes identifiers, e.g. btczyx
- `data_type`: data type (e.g. float32)
- `data_range`: tuple of (minimum, maximum)
- `shape`: specification of tensor shape
  - Either
    - `shape`: <exact shape with same length as `axes`>
  - or
    - `shape`: {`min`: <minimum shape with same length as `axes`>, `step`: <minimum shape change with same length as `axes`>} 

### `dependencies`

Dependency manager and dependency file, specified as <dependency manager>:<relative path to file>
For example:
- conda:./environment.yaml
- maven:./pom.xml
- pip:./requirements.txt
<!---
`I am not quite sure what we decided on for the uri identifiers in the end, I am sticking with the simplest option for now
<format>+<protocoll>://<path>`, e.g.: `conda+file://./req.txt`
-->


## Model Specification

A model entry in the bioimage.io model zoo is defined by a configuration file `<model name>.model.yaml`.
The configuration file must contain the [common keys](#common-keys) and the keys `test_input`, test_output, `inputs`, `outputs,` `prediction`, `training`. Note that only the model specification contains test data, for all other implementations, we assume that the underlying components are sufficiently tested and we just perform one integration test for running the model.

### `test_input`
Relative file path to test input. `language` and the file extension define its memory representation.
The input is always stored as list of tensors.

### `test_output`
Relative file path to test output. `language` and the file extension define its memory representation.
The input is always stored as list of tensors.

### `inputs`
Describes the input tensors expected by this model.
Must be a list of [tensor specifications](#tensor-specification).
<!--
Force this to be explicit, or also allow any?
-->

### `outputs`
Describes the output tensors from this model.
Must be a list of [tensor specifications](#tensor-specification).
<!--
Force this to be explicit, or also allow any, identity, same?
-->

### `prediction`
Specification of prediction for the model. Must cotain the following keys:
- `weights`: the default model weights used for prediction, it must be a key defined in the root node `weights`.
- `preprocess`:  list of transformations applied before the model input. Can be null if no preprocsssing is necessary. List entries must adhere to the [transformation entry](#transformation-entry) format.
- `postprocess`: list of transformations applied after the model input. Can be null if no preprocessing is necessary. List entries must adhere to the [transformation entry] format.
- `dependencies`: dependencies required to run prediction. See [transformation config](#transformation-specification).

### transformation entry
Must be a dictionary with the key `spec`: relative path or link to a [transformation specification](#-transformation-specification) file. The relative path must be specified as `file://./some/my_trafo.transformation.yaml`. The link as `https://github.com/some_repo/some_file/my_other_trafo.transformation.yaml`.
<!--
Is this the correct URI format now?
-->

Can contain the key `kwargs`: instantiation of keyword arguments for this transformation.

### `training`
Specification of training process used to obtain the model weights. Must contain the following keys:
- `source`: Implementation of the training process. Can either be a relative file and 
- `kwargs`: Keyword arguments for the training implementation, that are not part of `setup`.
- `setup`: The training set-up that is instantiated by the training function. It must contain the keys listed belows (for which we will provide parser functions.) It can consist additional keys, which needs to be parsed separately and may be used to extend the core library.
    - `weights`: pretrained weights loaded before training starts, must be a key specified in the root node `weights`.
    - `reader`: specification of a [reader config](#reader-specification).
    - `sampler`: specification of a [sampler config](#sampler-specification).
    - `preprocess`: list of [transformation entries](#transformation-entry) that are applied before tensors are fed to the model. 
    - `loss`: transformations that are applied to model outputs and loss.  list of [transformation entries](#transformation-entries). Last entry must be the actual loss.
    - `optimizer`: optimizer used in training. For now, we have no specification for this, but just use the framework specific implementation directly. We may want to change this.
      - `source`: Implementation of the optimizer. As usual, either relative path or importable from dependencies.
      - `kwargs`: keyword arguments for the optimizer

### `config`
A custom configuration field that can contain any other keys which are not defined above. It can be very specifc to a framework or specific tool. To avoid conflicted defintions, it is recommended to wrap configuration into a sub-field named with the specific framework or tool name. 

For example:
```yaml
config:
  # custom config for DeepImageJ, see https://github.com/bioimage-io/configuration/issues/23
  deepimagej:
    model_keys:
      # In principle the tag "SERVING" is used in almost every tf model
      model_tag: tf.saved_model.tag_constants.SERVING
      # Signature definition to call the model. Again "SERVING" is the most general
      signature_definition: tf.saved_model.signature_constants.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY
    test_information:  
      input_size: [2048x2048] # Size of the input images  
      output_size: [1264x1264 ]# Size of all the outputs  
      device: cpu # Device used. In principle either cpu or GPU  
      memory_peak: 257.7 Mb # Maximum memory consumed by the model in the device  
      runtime: 78.8s # Time it took to run the model
      pixel_size: [9.658E-4µmx9.658E-4µm] # Size of the pixels of the input
```
## Reader Specification

A reader entry in the bioimage.io model zoo is defined by a configuration file `<reader name>.reader.yaml`.
A reader implements access to data. A reader can read from one or multiple data-sets.
It implements an interface that allows random access to arbitrary sub-tensors of the data-set.
Data CAN be private!

The reader config must contain the [common keys](#common-keys) and the key `dependencies`.

## Sampler Specification
A sampler entry in the bioimage.io model zoo is defined by a configuration file `<sampler name>.sampler.yaml`.
A sampler defines a sequence of batches over a reader. 

The sampler config must contain the [common keys](#common-keys), the key `dependencies` and `outputs`, see output description in [the transformation specifiaction](#transformation-specification).
