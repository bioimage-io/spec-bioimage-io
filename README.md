# Specifications for BioImage.IO

This repository contains specifications defined by the BioImage.IO community. These specifications are used for defining fields in YAML files which we called `Resource Description Files` or `RDF`. The RDFs can be downloaded or uploaded to the [bioimage.io website](https://bioimage.io), produced or consumed by BioImage.IO-compatible consumers(e.g. image analysis software or other website). Currently we defined two types of RDFs: a dedicated RDF specification for AI models (i.e. `model RDF`) and a general RDF specification. The model RDF is a RDF with additional fields that specifically designed for describing AI models.


All the BioImage.IO-compatible RDF must fulfill the following rules:
 * Must be a YAML file encoded as UTF-8; If yaml syntax version is not specified to be 1.1 in the first line by `% YAML 1.1` it must be equivalent in yaml 1.1 and yaml 1.2. For differences see https://yaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyyaml.html#differences-with-pyyaml.
 * The RDF file extension must be `.yaml` (not `.yml`)
 * The RDF file can be saved in a folder (or virtual folder) or in a zip package, the following additional rules must apply:
   1. When stored in a local file system folder, github repo, zenodo deposition, blob storage virtual folder or similar kind, the RDF file name should match the pattern of `*.rdf.yaml`, for example `my-model.rdf.yaml`.
   2. When the RDF file and other files are zipped into a RDF package, it must be named as `rdf.yaml`.

As a general guideline, please follow the model RDF spec to describe AI models and use the general RDF spec for other resource types including `dataset`, `application`. You will find more details about these two specifications in the following sections. Please also note that the best way to check whether your RDF file is BioImage.IO-compliant is to run the BioImage.IO Validator against it.

## Resource Description File Specification

A BioImage.IO-compatible Resource Description File (RDF) is a YAML file with a set of specifically defined fields. 

You can find detailed field definitions here: 
   - [general RDF spec (latest)](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/rdf_spec_latest.md)
   - [general RDF spec (0.2.x)](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/rdf_spec_0_2.md)

The specifications are also available as json schemas: 
   - [general RDF spec (0.2.x, json schema)](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/rdf_spec_0_2.json)

[Here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/main/example_specs/rdf-examples.md) you can find some examples for using RDF to describe applications, notebooks, datasets etc.

## Model Resource Description File Specification

Besides the general RDF spec, the `Model Resource Description File Specification`(`model RDF`) defines a file format for representing pretrained AI models in [YAML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML). This format is used to describe models hosted on the [BioImage.IO](https://bioimage.io) model repository site.

You can find the latest `model RDF` here:
   - [model RDF spec (latest)](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/model_spec_latest.md)

Here is a list of model RDF Examples:
 - [Model RDF Examples](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/tree/main/example_specs/models).


## Collection Resource Description File Specification

The [`Collection Resource Description File Specification`](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/collection_spec_latest.md)(`collection RDF`) defines a file format for representing collections of resources for the [BioImage.IO](https://bioimage.io) website.

You can find the latest `collection RDF` here:
 - [collection RDF spec (latest)](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/collection_spec_latest.md)


## Linking resource items

You can create links to connect resource items by adding another resource item id to the `links` field. For example, if you want to associate an applicaiton with a model, you can set the links field of the models like the following:
```yaml
application:
  - id: HPA-Classification
    source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioimage-io/tfjs-bioimage-io/master/apps/HPA-Classification.imjoy.html

model:
  - id: HPAShuffleNetV2
    source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioimage-io/tfjs-bioimage-io/master/models/HPAShuffleNetV2/HPAShuffleNetV2.model.yaml
    links:
      - HPA-Classification
```

## Hosting RDFs

You can host the resource description file on one of the public git repository website, including Zenodo Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, or Gist.
In order to make it available in https://bioimage.io, you can submit the RDF package via the uploader.


## Recommendations

 * For AI models, consider using the model-specific spec (i.e. [model RDF](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/model_spec_latest.md)) instead of the general RDF. Only fallback to the general RDF if writing model specific RDF is not possible for some reason.
 * The RDF or package file name should not contain spaces or special characters, it should be concise, descriptive, in kebab case or camel case.
 * Due to the limitations of storage services such as Zenodo, which does not support subfolders, it is recommended to place other files in the same directory level of the RDF file and try to avoid using subdirectories.
 * Use the [bioimage.io spec validator](#bioimageio-spec-validator) to verify your YAML file
 * Store the yaml file in a version controlled Git repository (e.g. Github or Gitlab)
 * Use or upgrade to the latest format version
 

# bioimageio command-line interface (CLI) 
The BioImage.IO command line tool makes it easy to work with BioImage.IO RDFs. 
A basic version of it, documented here, is provided by the [bioimageio.spec package](bioimageio-python-package), which is extended by the [bioimageio.core](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python) package.


## validate

It is recommended to use this validator to verify your models when you write it manually or develop tools for generating RDF files.


Use the `validate` command to check for formatting errors like missing or invalid values:
```
bioimageio validate <MY-MODEL-SOURCE>
```

`<MY-MODEL-SOURCE>` may be a local RDF yaml "`<MY-MODEL>/rdf.yaml`" or a DOI / URL to a zenodo record, or a URL to an rdf.yaml file.

To see if your model is compatible to the [latest bioimage.io model format](https://github.com/bioimage-io/spec-bioimage-io/blob/gh-pages/model_spec_latest.md) use the spec validator with the `--update-format` flag:
```
bioimageio validate --update-format `<MY-MODEL-SOURCE>`
```

The output of the `validate` command will indicate missing or invalid fields in the model file. For example, if the field `timestamp` was missing it would print the following:
```
{'timestamp': ['Missing data for required field.']}
```
or if the field `test_inputs` does not contain a list, it would print:
```
{'test_inputs': ['Not a valid list.']}.
```

## update-format
Similar to the `validate` command with `--update-format` flag the `update-format` command attempts to convert an RDF 
to the latest applicable format version, but saves the result in a file for further manual editing:
```
bioimageio update-format <MY-MODEL-SOURCE> <OUTPUT-PATH>
```

# bioimageio.spec Python package
The bioimageio.spec package allows to work with BioImage.IO RDFs within Python.
The commands on which the bioimageio CLI is based can be used as functions.
Additionally, IO functions are provided to work with BioImage.IO RDFs as 'raw nodes' Python objects, e.g. the raw representation of a model RDF 0.4 at [bioimageio.spec.model.v0_4.raw_nodes](bioimageio/spec/model/v0_4/raw_nodes.py#L122-L140).
The [bioimageio.core](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python) package extends this 'raw' representation for more convenience.

[//]: # (TODO: documentation for bioimageio.spec)


## installation
bioimageio.spec can be installed with either `pip` or `conda`:

```
# pip
pip install -U bioimageio.spec

# conda
conda install -c conda-forge bioimageio.spec
```

As a dependency it is included in [bioimageio.core](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python#installation) library, which extends bioimageio.spec with more powerful commands like 'predict'.
