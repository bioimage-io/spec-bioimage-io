# Postprocessing operations in model spec 0.3
The supported operations that are valid in postprocessing. IMPORTANT: these operations must return float32 tensors, so that their output can be consumed by the models.
- `Binarize` Binarize the tensor with a fixed threshold, values above the threshold will be set to one, values below the threshold to zero.
  - key word arguments:
    - `threshold` The fixed threshold
  - reference implementation: https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python/blob/main/bioimageio/core/prediction_pipeline/_processing.py#L108-L115
- `Clip` Set tensor values below min to min and above max to max.
  - key word arguments:
    - `max` maximum value for clipping
    - `min` minimum value for clipping
  - reference implementation: https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python/blob/main/bioimageio/core/prediction_pipeline/_processing.py#L116-L124
- `ScaleLinear` Fixed linear scaling.
  - key word arguments:
    - `axes` The subset of axes to scale jointly. For example xy to scale the two image axes for 2d data jointly. The batch axis (b) is not valid here.
    - `[gain]` multiplicative factor
    - `[offset]` additive term
  - reference implementation: https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python/blob/main/bioimageio/core/prediction_pipeline/_processing.py#L133-L158
- `ScaleMeanVariance` Scale the tensor s.t. its mean and variance match a reference tensor.
  - key word arguments:
    - `mode` One of per_dataset (mean and variance are computed for the entire dataset) and per_sample (mean and variance are computed for each sample individually).
    - `reference_tensor` Name of tensor to match.
  - reference implementation: https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python/blob/main/bioimageio/core/prediction_pipeline/_processing.py#L159-L163
- `ScaleRange` Scale with percentiles.
  - key word arguments:
    - `axes` The subset of axes to normalize jointly. For example xy to normalize the two image axes for 2d data jointly. The batch axis (b) is not valid here.
    - `mode` One of per_dataset (mean and variance are computed for the entire dataset) and per_sample (mean and variance are computed for each sample individually).
    - `[eps]` Epsilon for numeric stability: `out = (tensor - v_lower) / (v_upper - v_lower + eps)`; with `v_lower,v_upper` values at the respective percentiles. Default value: 10^-6.
    - `[max_percentile]` The upper percentile used for normalization, in range 1 to 100. Has to be bigger than min_percentile. Default value: 100. The range is 1 to 100 instead of 0 to 100 to avoid mistakenly accepting percentiles specified in the range 0.0 to 1.0.
    - `[min_percentile]` The lower percentile used for normalization, in range 0 to 100. Default value: 0.
    - `[reference_tensor]` Tensor name to compute the percentiles from. Default: The tensor itself. If mode==per_dataset this needs to be the name of an input tensor.
  - reference implementation: https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python/blob/main/bioimageio/core/prediction_pipeline/_processing.py#L164-L220
- `Sigmoid` 
  - reference implementation: https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python/blob/main/bioimageio/core/prediction_pipeline/_processing.py#L221-L226
- `ZeroMeanUnitVariance` Subtract mean and divide by variance.
  - key word arguments:
    - `axes` The subset of axes to normalize jointly. For example xy to normalize the two image axes for 2d data jointly. The batch axis (b) is not valid here.
    - `mode` One of fixed (fixed values for mean and variance), per_dataset (mean and variance are computed for the entire dataset) and per_sample (mean and variance are computed for each sample individually).
    - `[eps]` epsilon for numeric stability: `out = (tensor - mean) / (std + eps)`. Default value: 10^-6.
    - `[mean]` The mean value(s) to use for `mode == fixed`. For example `[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]` in the case of a 3 channel image where the channels are not normalized jointly.
    - `[std]` The standard deviation values to use for `mode == fixed`. Analogous to mean.
