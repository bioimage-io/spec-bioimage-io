## 🛈 Versioining scheme

To keep the bioimageio.spec Python package version in sync with the (model) description format version, bioimageio.spec is versioned as MAJOR.MINRO.PATCH.LIB, where MAJOR.MINRO.PATCH correspond to the latest model description format version implemented and LIB may be bumped for library changes that do not affect the format version.
[This change was introduced with bioimageio.spec 0.5.3.1](changelog.md#bioimageiospec-0531).

## Δ Changelog

The [changelog](changelog.md) describes changes to the bioimageio.spec Python package and changes to the resource description format it implements separately.
